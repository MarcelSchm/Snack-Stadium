## Setup Guide
Have all of your materials, you can start building your snack stadium by following these steps:

**Detailed Steps TBD**

Mainly sticked to the inspiration, but did some things different (e.g. some values in instruction were wrong, used UHU REPAIR ALL POWERKITT instead of sets of chair angles, different sizes of boxes).
Did not document the process properly in Github, but will try to update the changes if someone is interested.


In the repository you can find CAD Models of all Parts created with Catia V5.


When done, fill each compartment with your desired snacks. 


# Acknowledgments
I got the main inspiration for this snack stadium from [this DIY Video of Hagebau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJcGIodzV_0). I also added their [instruction PDF](pictures/DIY_Anleitung_Snack_Bowl_2021-41728-31678.pdf) to this repository in case it gets lost. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if there’s anything else I can do for you.
